Animoog's Exhaustive List of Expansion Packs
============================================

The full documentation is found at http://animoog.org/database/expansion-packs/

Why
---
From the website: _"Lots of expansion packs can be purchased and installed directly from within the Animoog under the ‘STORE’ tab, however, several high-quality presets and timbres are not available from within the app itself — that’s the value of the following table, to help us find those valuable gems no matter where they hide!"_


What you'll find here
---------------------

* A copy of the Expansion Packs table in html
* A copy of the Expansion Packs table in csv (actually, semicolon separated)

Version history of this content is found on the Expansion Packs page on Animoog.org

CAREFUL -- THE VERSION HERE ON GITHUB IS NOT UP TO DATE -- IF YOU'D LIKE AN UP-TO-DATE HTML OR CSV VERSION OF THE TABLE, LET ME KNOW IN AN ISSUE

To do
-----

* Find a way for the original content of the table to be fully crowdsourced (such as by using Mediawiki?). I'm currently using the TablePress WordPress plugin and seriously considered the ABASE WordPress plugin
* Add decorations to the table in html format (see this <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/display-table-in-a-new-full-screen-window">related discussion</a>)
