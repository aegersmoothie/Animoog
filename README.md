Animoog Love
============

What you'll find on this Github repos is content pertaining to the <a href="http://animoog.org" target="_blank">Animoog.org website</a>.

There's currently two sub-projects you'll find here:
* The <a href="/map/">Animoog Players Map</a>, associated to <a href="http://animoog.org/playing/map/" target="_blank">animoog.org/playing/map/</a>
* The <a href="/expansion-packs/">raw content of Animoog Expansion Packs table</a>, presets and timbres which are especially difficult to find because not available from within the app. This content is associated to <a href="http://animoog.org/database/expansion-packs/ target="_blank"">animoog.org/database/expansion-packs/</a>

See the READMEs in the sub-folders for details about each of those components

I'm open and willing to add much more, simply share your ideas and comments in the <a href="https://github.com/alexandreleroux/Animoog/issues">issues</a>

Everything you'll find both on the website and in this Git repos is openly licensed
